/*
 * Common base of the PSP popup UI windows (MAIN MENU, ROM Browser).
 * Every popup owns an indexed GE texture rasterized by the display
 * thread and presented by TV as one quad above the shared dim
 * backdrop, in the 480x272 UI coordinate space.
 *
 * Shared machinery living here:
 *   - tex/clut storage and the common palette;
 *   - the paint_seq/painted_seq repaint handshake between the worker
 *     thread (state changes) and the display thread (rasterizer);
 *   - rasterization helpers (fill_rect, print_text2x);
 *   - the keyup edge input helper for list navigation.
 *
 * Threading split, as before: the worker mutates the popup state and
 * calls mark_dirty(); the display thread polls needs_repaint() and
 * calls the subclass paint().
