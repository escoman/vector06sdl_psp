 * Preview image loader and saver (PNG via stb_image / stb_image_write).
 *
 * Preview files live next to the ROM with the same base name
 * ("riseout.rom" -> "riseout.png") and as state screenshots
 * (SAVES/<rom>/stateN.png). The format is PNG: typically 10-20x
 * smaller than the old uncompressed TGA, which matters a lot on
 * PSP memory cards and load times.
 *
 * The pixels are converted straight into the PSP GE layout (memory
 * bytes A B G R, i.e. uint32 0xAABBGGRR of GU_PSM_8888) and written
 * into a caller-owned power-of-two texture buffer. Images larger
 * than the destination are shrunk with a box filter, aspect ratio
 * always preserved; smaller images are copied 1:1 (the GE does any
 * upscaling when the quad is drawn).

/* Load path into dst (dst_w x dst_h pixels, PSP 8888 layout).
 * Returns true when a preview was decoded: *out_w and *out_h hold
 * the stored image size (<= dst_w/dst_h, aspect preserved). Returns
 * false on any missing/undecodable/oversized file — the dst content
 * is undefined then and the caller must treat it as "no preview". */
